This project is possible thanks to many people:

-   [David Robinson](https://twitter.com/drob) for recording the screencasts.
-   [Alex Cookson](https://twitter.com/alexcookson) and [Eric Fletcher](https://twitter.com/iamericfletcher) for painstakingly time-stamping and describing all the content.
-   [Oscar Baruffa](https://twitter.com/OscarBaruffa) for creating this website collating it all.
-   [Thomas Mock](https://twitter.com/thomas_mock) for maintaining the [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) challenge.
-   Countless others for R, RStudio, Quarto and a gazillion packages that make this all possible.

If you'd like to keep up to date with this website and other resources from Oscar Baruffa, sign up to the [newsletter](https://oscarbaruffa.com/newsletter/) for posts about R, data and careers.

This project is possible thanks to many people:

-   David Robinson for recording the screencasts.
-   Alex Cookson and Eric Fletcher for painstakingly timestamping and describing all the content.
-   Oscar Baruffa for creating this website collating it all.
-   Thomas Mock for maintaining the TidyTuesday challenge.
-   Countless others for R, RStudio, Quarto and a gazillion packages that make this all possible.

If you'd like to keep up to date with this website and other resources from Oscar Baruffa, sign up to the newsletter.
